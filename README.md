# JavaScript Tiny Compiler

## Introduction

Welcome to the JavaScript Tiny Compiler project! This repository hosts a compact yet powerful compiler for JavaScript, following the instructions provided by Jamie Kyle. The compiler is designed to walk you through the essential stages of the compilation process: Lexical Analysis, Syntactic Analysis, Transformation, and Code Generation. By understanding these stages, you will gain insights into how compilers work and how they can efficiently process code.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis:** The compiler begins by performing lexical analysis, breaking down the input code into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, and symbols. This step lays the foundation for the subsequent stages of analysis and transformation.

- **Syntactic Analysis:** Next, the compiler performs syntactic analysis to parse the tokens generated during lexical analysis into a hierarchical structure, typically represented as a syntax tree. This phase ensures that the code adheres to the grammar rules of JavaScript.

- **Transformation:** After parsing the code, the compiler applies transformations to the syntax tree. These transformations may include optimizations, simplifications, or other modifications to enhance the efficiency and readability of the code.

- **Code Generation:** Finally, the compiler generates optimized JavaScript code based on the transformed syntax tree. This generated code is ready for execution in a JavaScript environment, delivering a seamless compilation experience.

## Usage

To use the JavaScript Tiny Compiler:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the compiler using the provided command-line interface (CLI) tool.
4. Provide a Lisp statement as input to the compiler.
5. Observe the output JavaScript code generated by the compiler.

## Example

Here's an example of using the JavaScript Tiny Compiler:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/JavaScript-Tiny-Compiler.git

$ cd JavaScript-Tiny-Compiler

$ node index
```

When you run this example, the compiler processes the Lisp statement `(multiply 2 (divide 5 9))` saved as an input variable in the `index.js` file and generates the equivalent JavaScript code `multiply(10, divide(5, 9))`
