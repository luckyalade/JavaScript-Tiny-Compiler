# JavaScript-Tiny-Compiler
This project houses a compact yet tiny powerful compiler for JavaScript. It encompasses the essential stages of a compiler: Lexical Analysis, Syntactic Analysis, Transformation, and Code Generation. These stages work harmoniously to process JavaScript code efficiently and produce optimized output with a seamless compilation experience.
